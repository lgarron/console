# `console.log()`

For when you don't want to think about what language you're using, and just get stuff onto the screen.

    arr = [21, -22, [23, 24], "owl", {"eagle": [25]}]
    map = {"cat": [31, 32], "dog": 33, 34: "fox"}

    console.log("Values:", 1337, arr, map)

### Limitations

- ¹ Arrays and maps must be homogeneous, due to language type restrictions.
- ² `console.Log` requires a capital `L` in Go.
- ³ These languages don't support importing file paths. You have to modify the import path.
- ⁴ `console.log()` with parentheses only accepts a single argument; `console.log[]` with braces is required for more. (Also, associative arrays break printing on the commandline in Mathematica 10. Old-fashioned lists of `Rule`s still work, though.)

If you know workarounds for these limitations (however hacky!), let me know.

## Goals

- Simple import without configuring import paths
- Single `console.log()` call in lowercase
- Multiple heterogeneous arguments can be passed to `console.log()`, inc. at the least the following types:
  - Primitive types: integer, string
  - Array/list/vector, preferably heterogeneous
  - Map/dictionary/associative array, preferably heteregeneous key and value types
  - Any value in the language with an associated string serialization (e.g. a `toString()` implementation)
- Arguments are printed to `stdout` inline, with a space separator and a trailing newline
  - Where possible (e.g. DevTools JS console), arguments are displayed semantically

### Non-Goals

- Print types as similarly to JS as possible.
